## **Business Problem**

Microsoft has decided to venture into the film production industry. I have been tasked to figure out on how they can venture into the industry and make a good return on investment. Since they are completely new to this industry, I have to utilize all the data provided to help microsoft draft a blueprint on the steps and measures to take as they commence  this business in the best way possible. The choice made should be  purely based on informed decision.


## **Data Understanding**
As a data scientist exploring the film industry, it's clear that this domain is intricate, involving multiple factors and stakeholders that influence the success of a movie. Important elements include the quality of the screenplay, the star power of actors, promotional strategies, timing of release, and audience preferences for specific genres. Drama ,action and adventure movies often perform well, whereas niche genres like documentaries may have a smaller but dedicated audience. Our analysis incorporates a variety of data sources such as box office figures, social media engagement, and critical reviews, employing techniques like regression analysis and sentiment analysis to identify patterns. 

For Microsoft's new venture into movie production, our goal is to use these findings to guide their filmmaking strategies effectively. By understanding the complexities of the industry and adopting data-driven approaches, Microsoft can optimize their film lineup, leading to greater success and profitability in this competitive landscape.
